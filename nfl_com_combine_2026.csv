Put on skates and rolled out of gaps by down blocks.
Can’t play in schemes asking him to sit down and take on blocks.
Unable to withstand longer block engagement.
Lack of lever length and hand moves for early rush wins.
Doesn’t have enough brute strength to crank up a bull rush.

Punches, extends and locks out when setting edges.
Attack-oriented with play strength for block destruction.
Powers through back-side cutoffs by TEs and maintains fits on lateral block engagements with OTs.

Good upfield pace to set up his speed-to-power conversion.
Adequate footwork and transition quickness on inside rush moves.
